# StringCalculator

## Open Questions
At the end we tried to refactor but we ended up implementing a new feature instead.
"Obviously" if we are intending to refactor we should only do that, but how would we have prevented adding the feature?

## Retros

## 22/09/2025

1. How did that feel?
    - Positive
    - Out of flow
    - Productive
2. What did we do that we want to make sure we do more of?
    - Rob: Created a routine to help him with the flow. Continue iterating on it.
    - Announcing talker/typist at the start of a cycle
    - Taking account of each other's preferences
3. What can we try next time?
    - Andrzej: take small notes as we go, so I can better reflect on what happened in the retro
    - Create a skeleton project to start a kata from
    - Balance flow with experimentation - we each keep an "inbox" and after each cycle we take a minute to discuss
      anything we wrote down

Next time
- Continue with the String Calculator kata

1. How did that feel?
   - Andrzej: Good and productive
   - Unsure of TDD flow
   - Rob: Good learning opportunities
2. What did we do that we want to make sure we do more of?
   - Deferring side quests and writing things down
   - Some implicit things: switching over, communicating well
   - Finding the middle ground between flow and experimentation, we are definitely improving at this
2.5 What isn't working
   - Running out of time, is that normal?
   - Forgetting refactoring
3. What can we try next time?
   - Keep an inbox
   - Switching on green or ping pong?
4. What we experimented with:
   - mob.sh - Required some setup, but worked well with using the URL so we could both hear

## 06/10/2025
- Andrzej: Felt good again, making progress
- Rob: Feeling frustrated/unsure, it is hard to "slow" down
- We tried ping ponging this time
- Created an inbox

## 13/10/2025
- still feel overwhelmed by where/when to start "simple" refactoring
- liked the Rob's Strong Style Ping-Pong (TM)
- also liked the strong style ping-pong since it helps us both practice navigating
- we need to "try" more than "talk" because we have tests!!!
- it is good to be able to bring things we've learned and practice them in a "safe sandbox"
